## 🔍 1. Introduction [↑](#-table-of-contents)

Modern CCTV systems often come with their own closed ecosystems, mobile apps, and cloud dependencies. While this works for average users, advanced users (us with HA) and integrators increasingly seek **local control**, **event-based automations**, and **unified dashboards**.

This article documents my hands-on experience integrating a **Dahua NVR and multiple IP cameras** into **Home Assistant**, using tools like `go2rtc` for RTSP stream handling and the official Dahua integration for **smart event-based triggers**.

The goal was simple:  
- **Stream all cameras reliably inside Home Assistant**,  
- **Use Dahua's advanced detection events (tripwires, IVS)** as triggers,  
- **Avoid cloud lock-in**,  
- And **make security visuals and controls available on wall-mounted tablets and mobile phones.**

If you're looking for a **stable, private, and responsive** way to bring your CCTV system into your smart home, this guide covers the full pipeline: from camera installation and Dahua setup to smart lighting automations, dashboards, and UI best practices.

---

## 🧰 2. Requirements [↑](#-table-of-contents)

Before starting the integration, make sure you have the following or equivalent components in place.

### 🖥️ Core Software
- **Home Assistant OS**  
  _Also compatible with Supervised and Docker-based installs_
- **HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)** – we will install it later
- **go2rtc Add-on** – will install later

### 📸 CCTV Hardware
- **Dahua NVR** with Smart Motion/IVS Event Support  
  _Model used by me: `DHI-NVR2108HS-I`_
- **Dahua IP Cameras** with Tripwire / IVS Support / SmartMotion 
  _Models used by me: `DH-IPC-HFW3441E-SA`_

### 🌐 Network and Power
- **PoE Switch** (Power over Ethernet)  
  _Used to power and connect all cameras directly_
- **Structured LAN/WAN Setup**  
  _Router with internal-only access to NVR/cams; no port forwarding required, unless you want to use Dahua App in WAN_

### 💾 Storage & Performance
- **Sufficient NVR Storage Capacity**  
  _Depends on: camera resolution, bitrate, retention duration, 2-4Tb is usually enogh_
- **Decent HA hardware**  
  _Raspberry Pi 4 is a minimal baseline. More cams = better CPU and storage. Also dashboard tablets/phones should have decent performance to quickly load multiple streams_

## 🧱 3. Dahua Cameras Overview & Integration Limitations [↑](#-table-of-contents)

Dahua is one of the most widely used CCTV brands worldwide, known for offering a good balance between price, performance, and professional features. Their lineup includes:
- **NVRs** (Network Video Recorders) that centralize recording and event processing
- **IP cameras** that support ONVIF, RTSP, and in many cases, **smart detection events** like tripwire crossing, intrusion zones, and face detection

### 🧩 Ecosystem Breakdown
- Dahua NVRs are designed to work best with Dahua-brand cameras, but **ONVIF-compatible** models from other brands (e.g., Reolink, Hikvision) may work with limited features.
- **Smart Detection Events** (IVS) are often processed on-camera, with the NVR aggregating or forwarding them to third-party systems, like Home Assistant.
- Most Dahua cameras support **RTSP streaming**, which is very useful for integrating with HA dashboards and go2rtc to achieve the best performance results.

### ⚠️ Integration Limitations
While Dahua hardware is solid, integration into Home Assistant comes with some constraints:
- The **official Dahua HA integration** supports only **basic smart events** (motion, IVS tripwire, tamper). Advanced analytics (e.g., facial detection, people counting) are **not exposed** via the current API.
- **Two-way audio and PTZ control** is very limited or not available through Home Assistant, more on that later.
- Camera settings must still be configured through the **web interface or Dahua ConfigTool**.
- No official or clean MQTT support.

### 🛒 Advice for New Buyers
If you're building a new system:
- Choose cameras that support **IVS events (tripwire, intrusion zones)** — these work well in HA.
- Stick to **fixed lens models** unless you specifically need motorized zoom or PTZ.
- Consider using **turret-style cameras** outdoors — less glare and IR bleeding compared to domes.

### 📦 Local vs. Cloud Storage
- Dahua NVRs store footage locally on internal HDDs.
- Optionally, cameras can **send snapshots via FTP to NAS or external storage** on motion.
- Unlike cloud-based brands (e.g., Eufy, Arlo), Dahua systems allow **fully local operation**, which is ideal for privacy-conscious users.

In comparison with other known brands, like Hikvision, Dahua offers pretty much the same capabilities, depending on the exact model lines. Here is an example of comparison Hikvision vs Dahua vs Tiandy(another Chinese brand).

## 🛠️ 4. Camera(s) Installation Tips and Web-based Setup [↑](#-table-of-contents)

Setting up CCTV cameras isn't just about plugging them in. The physical mounting, angle, network planning, and web-based configuration all impact reliability, detection accuracy, and automation success.

### 📍 4.1 Physical Installation Tips [↑](#-table-of-contents)

- **Mounting height:** For human detection, 2.5–3 meters is ideal. Too high and you miss faces/details, too low and you decrese field of view and invite tampering.
- **Avoid glare:** Don’t point cameras directly at light sources (sun!, lamps, or car headlights). Use **turret-style cams** outdoors to reduce IR reflection.
- **Shelter from weather:** Even IP67-rated cams benefit from small roof covers. It protects lenses from raindrops and maintains clean image quality. While installing, make sure to use additional compatible camera mounts(IP67). They are sold separately. 
- **Cable management:** Always use weatherproof boxes or grommets for cable exits. Very important advice - do not neglect RJ45 waterproof connector caps, even if you are sure there is no water getting near the camera! One unfortunate rain/thunderstorm/flood and POE can short. For long-term durability, run PoE via proper CAT5e/6 cabling inside walls or conduit.
- **No blind spots:** Review camera fields of view in real time during installation. Avoid overly wide angles where humans become tiny blobs.
- Do not neglect **personal safety** on ladders/hights! Make sure someone is available to help you. 

> 🛠️ _Pro tip:_ Use your phone and a PoE tester or temporary injector to preview the stream live while adjusting position.

Here is a **short video of one of my cams**, just to demonstrate how it's mounted and provide some visual tips:

### 🌐 4.2 Web-Based Configuration [↑](#-table-of-contents)

Each Dahua camera has a built-in web UI, accessible via IP address. This is where most critical config is done before HA integration.

- **Initial IP Setup:**  
  Use Dahua’s [ConfigTool](https://www.dahuasecurity.com/support/downloadCenter) to scan and assign IP addresses, or access directly if your router lists new devices. I prefer doing it via WEB-UI, as long as cam gets IP from DHCP(enabled on default). Also, important thing - make sure to assign Static IPv4 to your cameras and NVR(s) or static DHCP binds in your router/dhcp server configs and in cam WEB-UI/Dahua tool - HA integration will use one IP to get data from Dahua device and we would not want it to change. <details>
                                                                                                <summary>📸 IP Config (Click to Expand)</summary>
                                                         <img width="1643" height="679" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75ef5e8d-88ac-44e6-bf71-8d486d1b3ddc" /> </details> 

    > 🔐 _Security Tip:_ Disable UPnP on your router and change default Dahua passwords immediately.

- **Port Layout (defaults):**  
  - Web UI: `HTTP 80` / `HTTPS 443`
  - RTSP: `554` - change if you need
  - ONVIF - uses HTTP/HTTPS for communication: usually `8080` or `80`  or `443`
  - TCP/UDP: `37777`/`37778` - to communicate with NVR, Apps, etc., - network ports. ConfigTool often uses port `37020` for discovery.
  - Max Connection `10` (1~20) - can be used as an additional security layer if you are sure how many max connections(Live views, for example) can happen at a time

- **Time Sync:**  
  Somehow, Dahua still has well-known issues with Time. Enabling NTP and syncing with your PC didn't work for me most times(my home lab + a few commercial installs). What I really recommend is choosing your Time Zone and setting up DST(Daylight Saving Time) if it happens in your region. Still, after that your Time Zone may be 1 hour ahead of real clock.. so try picking similar time zones and eventually you will set up normal time. Oh, and it's best to set up settings propagation from NVR to IP Cams for convenience and ease of set-up, just make sure you configure static IPs first.

  Here are a few screenshots of System/Time WEB Config:

- **Stream Setup (RTSP):** [↑](#-table-of-contents)
  IP Cameras usually have a few stream channels - Main Stream for high-qulity recordings, saved to HDD/NAS/Cloud and Sub Streams for Live Views(Mobile App, 3rd Party Services(Home Assistant), RTSP Web streams, etc.) Enable both **Main Stream** (for recordings) and **Sub Stream** (for dashboards or live view). Match resolutions and codecs to what go2rtc or HA supports best — typically H.264.
  <details>
    <summary>📸 My Stream Config (Click to Expand)</summary>

  <img width="1752" height="724" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e2f215-72a6-46bc-867b-2b4427dfe189" /> </details>
  Now, Dahua Cams/NVRs(and lots of other vendors) do not have a dedicated "RTSP ON/OFF" switch, and RTSP(_Real Time Streaming Protocol_) is enabled by default. What is important is to understand URL Link structure for Dahua Cams/NVRs. Those do differ vendor to vendor.

  Example:

        `rtsp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@CAMERA_IP:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0`

    Where:

     - `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` are the credentials set up on cam web interface(or propagated from NVR)

     - `CAMERA_IP` is cam's IPv4/IPv6 address

     - `554` Port is 554 by default

     - `channel=1` — first camera input (for NVRs or standalone cam)

     - `subtype=1` — sub stream (low-res, low bitrate), subtype=0 is usually Main Stream just FYI


 - **Regarding **ONVIF**(_Open Network Video Interface Forum_)** - it allows devices from different manufacturers to work together seamlessly, even if they don't have native compatibility. It also includes features like device discovery, configuration, user management, events, and PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) control. And allows for it's own **network discovery** - this will become usefull later when we configure go2rtc Add-on for HA, so I recommend enabling it.

- **User Management:** [↑](#-table-of-contents)
  Create a dedicated `homeassistant` user with only the needed permissions(live is enough). Avoid using admin credentials for automation integrations. Make sure to write down username and password - those are used to access RTSP link.
  Example:

**This covers basic configs to manage Camera, get Live RTSP Stream from it, and discover them via ONVIF. But we need the events themselves to bind Home Assistant Automations to. In order to do this let's make sure Event(s) are configured correctly on the Camera(s)**

- **Events:** [↑](#-table-of-contents)
  
  To cover all bases, I have **Video Detection**(Only Motion Detection), **Smart Motion Detection**(Recognizes Human/Vehicle silhouette), **Audio Detection**(Abnormality threshold based), **Smart Detection**(IVS   plan), and **Abnormality Detection**(Network disconnect, Access violation, and Voltage shifts) enabled. Let's cover them one by one:

    - **Video Detection**(Motion Detection) - uses a generic algorithm and sensitivity threshold to compare frames and trigger an Event. See the Screenshot for the configuration. <details>

One more **important thing regarding events** - you may have a question about "overlapping events", like - "what if we have all of those enabled simultaneously, and a screaming person runs in our camera's frame? Is there going to be a dozen similar recordings cluttering up our storage?" The short answer is - No. For a longer explanation, I have researched it for you! Additional read under spoiler:

<details>
<summary>📼 TL;DR – What happens if multiple events are triggered at once? (Click to Expand)</summary>

------------------------------------
**Usual Camera Behavior**
The camera itself sends individual event notifications (Motion, SMD, Audio, IVS, etc.) — each as a separate trigger. But it does not handle recording logic — it just says: "Hey! Something happened!"

**NVR Behavior – The Decision Maker**
The NVR controls recording, and here's what matters:

📅 Recording Schedule Type
In the NVR settings (under “Storage > Schedule”), you define which types of events should trigger recordings:

  - Regular – always recording
  - Motion – triggered by basic motion detection
  - Alarm – includes audio detection, IVS, SMD, etc.

MD+Alarm – combo events

If you have Motion + Audio + SMD + IVS all enabled, and they're set to trigger "Alarm Recording", the _NVR will start one continuous recording during that event window, even if multiple triggers fire_.
It will not create 3 separate video files — it records a unified stream, with a timestamped metadata log of each event.

**Important Notes:**
Dahua NVRs merge overlapping event triggers into one recording stream. The pre-record and post-record buffer applies once — not per trigger. For example, if SMD and audio fire within 2 seconds of each other, the NVR just keeps rolling. No duplicated storage or clutter, unless you explicitly configure snapshot uploads or FTP per event.

**Example Scenario:**
A person screams and runs across the camera's field of view, triggering:

  - Motion Detection (entire frame change)
  - Smart Motion (SMD) for Human
  - Audio Detection (scream)

**Result:**
A single recording clip is created (e.g., 18:03:22–18:03:58)
Each event is logged with its type and timestamp
You can search/filter later by event type
